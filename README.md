This is my project named Blog API where i have learned about basics of Django Rest Frameword.
i came to know how to  handle api endpoints using DRF spectualar,POSTMAN.
mainly about authentication,permissions and serializers,about viewsets.
i use token authentication in this project and token is generated for only super user.
similarly field filters are also used.
